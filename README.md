# Setup To Node

This is a little setup maden to use in nodejs projects. This setup  I see in a video of rocketseat, the link is: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCeGfFk-uCk>. But I restart to maden to show every part and showing to  you. So you can use this setup.

## EditorConfig

Before I made the setup I added the file .editorconfig. This file work with a extension called editor config and the extension dertemines some default settings to editor use. In my configuration I preffer 4 spaces of indentation, use charset like utf-8, break lines with unix style(lf), but this things you can change like you preffer.
